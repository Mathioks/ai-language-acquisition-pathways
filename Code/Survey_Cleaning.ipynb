    "Some participants wrote \"Japanese\" as one of the \"other\" languages, I decided to keep this in as I assume it means they feel confident enough in using Japanese to see it as a language they fully master. Upon further inspection all but one of these participants declared their level as N1, with one participants saying they are level N2. This makes it plausible that their mastery of the language is high enough. This introduces a skewing of the data as some other participants of N2-N1 level may have decided not to mention \"Japanese\" in the \"other languages\" section as they may have interpreted the questions as \"other languages besides your native language and Japanese, the language we are talking about in this survey\". Luckily this should not really affect any outcomes, as this should not reflect in aggregations we are aiming for.\n",
    "\n",
    "As there were way more languages present in this list to keep track of, it became hard to keep to a good structure of what language to place first. I tried to keep in mind the frequency of each language, but it may not always be fully correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people mentioned they speak a specific langauge only to a certain degree, or write 'a little bit of language X or Y'. As it's impossible for me to gauge just how good they really are in these languages, and their proficiency in other languages is not the main focus of this research, I decided to accept every mention of a language as \"known\" with the ideation that \"if a participant feels confident enough to mention they speak a specific language, I should just accept that as the truth\". Of course this will give a misguided view on the amount of languages the participants truly know, as some participants will be outliers due to loosely defining a language as \"known\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Some participants were not clear on what other language they know, these have sadly been marked as \"none\", with one participant in particular mentioning they know 25+ other language to varying degrees, but didn't mention any language specifically by name."

    "This one was also an open, optional question aiming to get more insights into the participant's thinking patterns. As such there is not a lot of data cleaning needed, as this data cannot be used for aggregation, but is rather used to get additional information. This was also the only optional question that did not have the (optional) notation in the survey. This was done on purpose, as I didn't want to bog down the users with forcing them to write down additional information (this could also lead to bad data). Yet at the other hand I really wanted this data point from as many participants as possible, as I think it can lead to very interesting insights. The hope was that participants would look for the (optional) notation to know which questions they can skip, and this way they would decide to fill this one in. Participants who really didn't want to fill it in would quickly notice it's not obligatory and can click through to the next questions."

Luckily, not many entries were unclear in what they wanted to convey, the only confusing one was the fact that both \"Bunpo\" and \"BunPro\" are different apps, and WaniKani seems to have some add-ons which people mentioned specifically. These have just been counted under \"WaniKani\" as I use these app names as umbrella terms which cover everything that is part of the app (as in Duolingo having both \"Super\" and \"Regular\" plans, and Anki having hundreds of plugins)"

Toggle is not a language learning app but a time tracking app, however, I decided to keep it as the intended use of an app does not dictate how people end up utilising it. I have used Toggle to \"gamify\" immersion time myself in the past, so I can see where it could be used as a language learning app."

I used to spend more time using Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) recreationally than studying Japanese—until I discovered Migaku and realized I could combine both. By generating mnemonics tailored to personal interests and high-dopamine visual triggers, I made studying far more engaging. Over the past two months, DDMLL has improved my retention and study efficiency by 3-5x. Because the process is self-rewarding, it makes consistency almost effortless for me.    1\n",

    "Since spaced repetition was not an option initially and was added by multiple people, I have decided to change it to \"flaschards\" as it is seen to combine both flashcards and spaced repetition, since that is the most common form in which flashcards are used. If spaced repetition is kept as is, it will score very low on the \"most useful features\" whilst flashcards scores very high for the reason that most people probably saw them as a combined thing as most people only use flashcards for the sake of spaced repetition. As such these two are now combined."

Since this participant is the only participant to mark spaced repetition as least useful, and is the only participant to add \"Plugin support\" in other, I'm unsure if they realised this question was asking for the \"least\" useful. Either way I will have to accept their entry, and it is possible that they feel different about this from all the other participants.

    "- While this seems to aim at an SRS system, SRS systems are mostly used to retain and build vocabulary -> To build vocabulary\n",

    "Study kanji\n",
    "- Kanji, while they can be learnt individually and out of the context of the words for which they are used, are essentially vocabulary pieces, However, I have decided to keep this as a new category -> To study kanji\n",
    "to retain kanji\n",
    "- This is also added to the new 'to study kanji' category, as retaining is a part of studying until they are known well enough to be used in reading/writing -> To study kanji\n",

    "To keep my long streak\n",
    "- An interesting one I hadn't thought of but was covered in the literature review, I expected this to be more of a subconscious thought, it's interesting to see that some people actively think this and know it's their main reason for continuing -> To keep my streak\n",
    "\n",
    "Importing my own content or finding what people imported already\n",

    "\n",
    "The following ones were changed to \"nan\" (empty) as they were additions next to other options, and the options that closest fit these additions were already selected by the participant, as such this would otherwise lead to duplicate data in one row.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memorization -> nan\n",

Now at least I know the N5 group is the only one that contains potentially two (neighboring) groups. On top of that the data of the higher level people is thought to potentially be more valuable for this question, as they have been through the levels and can define what felt like a plateau, even though they may have felt stuck early on, they may later realize that was not the \"plateau\" but that only happened at a later level for example.\n",

      "I am less than 3 months into my self study journey  using Duolingo to learn Japanese, but the further I’ve gone the more I’m finding the leaderboard less helpful. I want to stay in the promotion zone, or at least out of the demotion zone, to get to the next league but it’s impossible unless you’re breezing through a section a day. I don’t want to do that because I’ve forced myself to go through sections faster than I wanted and haven’t been able to retain the information because I’m moving too fast to let it really sink in for learning. My goal now is to review those sections at my own pace to really retain the information. As well as practice the vocabulary and sentence structure outside of the app with pen and paper and repetition. I WILL drop out of my current league because of this though. I’m not sure how people are scoring 2000 pts/day to stay in the top three or how they’re really even learning like that.     1\n",

I didn't use Anki until I was at an advanced level, to reinforce rarer vocab and kanji.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1\n",

      "Finding study materials that teach a thousands of vocabulary words in sentences, with audio. I used Glossika because it offered 5,000 words in sentences, and when I finished it did not actually teach that many words (counted verb forms one one verb as multiple words). I had only learned 1000 new words, not the close to 4000 new words I was expecting to learn. I realized it only covered beginner content, and I'd have to go to Clozemaster or Anki again. I really liked the hands-free audio only features of Glossika. I wish more learning materials had hands free audio options, and thousands of vocabulary words. For Japanese especially, I wish I could find more resources that genuinely teach 6,000-10,000 words.     1\n",

They just make you think you are by having you parrot/speak aloud a phrase they give you, without context for what that phrase is for.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                1\n",
