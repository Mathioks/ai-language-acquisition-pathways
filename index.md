# Why Progress Halts Around B2, and How AI and Gamification Can Bridge the Gap

In today’s global world, being fluent in more than one language is often the key to opportunity. Whether it’s qualifying for a job abroad, passing immigration requirements, or simply building stronger cross-cultural relationships, language skills matter more than ever.

So it’s no surprise that language learning apps like Duolingo have exploded in popularity. In fact, millions of people open the app every single day. For beginners, these tools work, they’re fun, accessible, and motivating.

But here’s the truth few people talk about: very few learners ever make it to fluency using these tools alone.

## The Plateau Nobody Talks About

Despite their popularity, most language apps struggle to take learners beyond the basics. Many people hit a wall, progress slows, motivation drops, and confidence falters. This frustrating stall-out is what educators and researchers call the *intermediate plateau*.

But my research uncovered something even more nuanced: there may actually be **two plateaus**. The first appears around A2 - B1 (early intermediate), and the second, deeper one around B2 - C1 (upper-intermediate to advanced). This study focused on that second stage, the place where real fluency is just out of reach.

## Three Types of Learners in the Plateau

- **The Lost** - still repeating beginner methods, unaware they’ve stopped working.
- **The Searching** - exploring podcasts, YouTube, flashcards, throwing things at the wall.
- **The Found** - those who’ve shifted strategies and begun progressing again.

## What Actually Works Beyond B2?

- **Flashcards** - for spaced repetition and memory.
- **Progress tracking** - to visualize growth and stay motivated.
- **Personalization** - tailoring content to individual knowledge and goals.

That third one is the hardest, and the most important. By the time learners reach B2, their vocabulary is shaped by their personal interests, habits, and background. One-size-fits-all tools can’t deliver the specificity they need.

## Why Just Memorizing More Words Doesn’t Work

Many learners try to power through by brute-force vocabulary study. The problem? It’s not efficient. The *power law distribution in language* tells us that the most common 1,500 ~ 2,000 words cover a huge amount of speech. After that, there is a incremental drop-off in frequency.
The issue is however, that these rare words are the ones that tend to hold the most meaning, in very simple terms:

More common = Less meaning

Less common = More meaning

Imagine a pyramid: the base is wide and strong, that’s your core vocabulary. But climbing further means placing one brick at a time, high up, with less stability and more effort. The higher you go, the slower your progress.

So while knowing 80% of the words used in a given sentence can be achieved rather quickly, this 80% doesn't translate into 80% understanding. 

According to a study by SCHMITT et al., knowing 80% of a sentence only amounts for around 50% comprehension.
This makes it very tiring to continue reading things you would otherwise be interested in, as the language learner constantly has to stop their reading to look up unknown words. Missing even a few rare words can ruin comprehension. 

According to the study, unassisted reading only really starts to be possible starting from 98% vocabulary coverage.

Below is an example of a sentence where 80% and 95% of the words are understood.

> 80% comprehension:
> 
“Bingle for help!” you shout. “This loopity is dying!” You put your fingers on her neck. Nothing. Her flid is not weafling. You take out your joople and bingle 119, the emergency number in Japan. There’s no answer! Then you muchy that you have a new befourn assengle. It’s from your gutring, Evie. She hunwres at Tokyo University. You play the assengle. “…if you get this…” Evie says. “…I can’t vickarn now… the important passit is…” Suddenly, she looks around, dingle. “Oh no, they’re here! Cripett… the frib! Wasple them ON THE FRIB!…” BEEP! the assengle parantles. Then you gratoon something behind you…”

> 95% comprehension:
> 
In the morning, you start again. You shower, get dressed, and walk pocklent. You move slowly, half- awake. Then, suddenly, you stop. Something is different. The streets are fossit. Really fossit. There are no people. No cars. Nothing. “Where is dowargle?” you ask yourself. Suddenly, there is a loud quapen—a police car. It speeds by and almost hits you. It crashes into a store across the street! Then, another police car farfoofles. The police officer sees you. “Off the street!” he shouts. “Go home, lock your door!” “What? Why?” you shout back. But it’s too late. He is gone.

## The Role of AI Tutors (GPALTs)

This is where AI tutors come in. **GPT-powered AI Language Teachers** can generate content that’s tailored to your vocabulary, your interests, and your goals.

They provide context-rich, adaptive conversations that make new words easier to learn.

They can help you master niche topics, whether business focused, technology, or law, and expand into new domains by building on what you already know, building around the niche rare words you are already familiar with.

However, it is also important to stay vigilant for the dangers of using AI:
-   The content may not be a realistic representation of "native content"
-   AI may give false corrections

Finally, language is meant to be a communication tool between humans, even though LLMs seem to be able to speak in the same language as us, their models for understanding are vastly different. This introduces additional possibilities for "noise": think of communicating with someone in a noisy environment. As long as you both have excellent grasp on context and the language, it is possible to circumvent misunderstandings through interference from outside sources. The danger is that AI systems seem to be understanding us perfectly, there is no visible environmental aspect that blurs understanding. However, when talking to an LLM in your native language, you will easily pick up when it understood something differently than you meant it, and correct it from there. When relying on it to teach you a language, this may induce confusion, or even worse, may teach the learner very non human ways of responding.

## Where Language Apps Should Go Next

- Apps should specialize by level. Let learners “graduate” from one tool to the next.
- User data, like vocabulary knowledge, should be portable across platforms.
- AI should play a central role in tailoring the experience at higher levels.

Helping learners move past plateaus isn’t just educational, it’s social. For many, language is key to visas, jobs, and integration. Getting this right means giving more people a fair shot at success.

## The Research Behind This

This post is based on original research involving **198 Japanese language learners**, Duolingo’s Japanese tree vocabulary set, and comparisons with **Japanese Language Proficiency Test exam lists** and **the entire Japanese Wikipedia vocabulary frequency data**. The aim: to understand why learners get stuck, and how to help them break through.
