# Why progress halts around B2, and how gamification and AI can bridge the gap

This project hosts a public-facing version of the research blog post explaining the challenges language learners face at the **intermediate plateau**, and how **Gamified Language Learning Apps** and **GPT-powered AI tutors (GPALTs)** could help bridge the gap toward advanced fluency.

🧠 **Author**: Mathioks  
📘 **Research Focus**: Japanese language acquisition, gamification, and AI in education  
📊 **Based on data from**:  
- A survey of 198 Japanese learners  
- Vocabulary data scraped from Duolingo (v6.11.4)  
- Top 10,000 Japanese words from entire Japanese Wikipedia
- Coto Academy JLPT vocabulary lists
- JLPT alignment on the entire database through the Jisho.org API
- JLPT alignment analysis

## 🔍 Blog Overview

The blog post walks readers through:
- Why learners hit a "wall" around B2–C1 level
- Why apps are useful but struggle to support learners throughout their entire language journey
- The limits of brute-force vocabulary study (power law distribution + lexical coverage)
- Why personalization, progress tracking, and flashcards are essential mechanics
- How AI-powered tools can provide tailored, compelling, and comprehensible input
