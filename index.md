    <h1>From Stuck to Fluent: Why Language Learning Apps Fail at B2, and How AI Can Bridge the Gap</h1>
    <p>In today’s global world, being fluent in more than one language is often the key to opportunity. Whether it’s qualifying for a job abroad, passing immigration requirements, or simply building stronger cross-cultural relationships, language skills matter more than ever.</p>
    <p>So it’s no surprise that language learning apps like Duolingo have exploded in popularity. In fact, millions of people open the app every single day. For beginners, these tools work, they’re fun, accessible, and motivating.</p>
    <p>But here’s the truth few people talk about: very few learners ever make it to fluency using these tools alone.</p>

    <h2>The Plateau Nobody Talks About</h2>
    <p>Despite their popularity, most language apps struggle to take learners beyond the basics. Many people hit a wall, progress slows, motivation drops, and confidence falters. This frustrating stall-out is what educators and researchers call the intermediate plateau.</p>
    <p>But my research uncovered something even more nuanced: there may actually be two plateaus. The first appears around A2–B1 (early intermediate), and the second, deeper one around B2–C1 (upper-intermediate to advanced). This study focused on that second stage, the place where real fluency is just out of reach.</p>

    <h2>Three Types of Learners in the Plateau</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Lost</strong> – still repeating beginner methods, unaware they’ve stopped working.</li>
        <li><strong>The Searching</strong> – exploring podcasts, YouTube, flashcards, throwing things at the wall.</li>
        <li><strong>The Found</strong> – those who’ve shifted strategies and begun progressing again.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What Actually Works Beyond B2?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Flashcards – for spaced repetition and memory.</li>
        <li>Progress tracking – to visualize growth and stay motivated.</li>
        <li>Personalization – tailoring content to individual knowledge and goals.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>That third one is the hardest, and the most important. By the time learners reach B2, their vocabulary is shaped by their personal interests, habits, and background. One-size-fits-all tools can’t deliver the specificity they need.</p>

    <h2>Why Just Memorizing More Words Doesn’t Work</h2>
    <p>Many learners try to power through by brute-force vocabulary study. The problem? It’s not efficient. The power law of language tells us that the most common 2,000 words cover a huge amount of speech. After that, each new word shows up less often and adds less value.</p>
    <p>Imagine a pyramid: the base is wide and strong, that’s your core vocabulary. But climbing further means placing one brick at a time, high up, with less stability and more effort. The higher you go, the slower your progress.</p>
    <p>You also need lexical coverage, understanding enough words in a sentence to guess the meaning of the rest. Around 98% is the magic number. Missing even a few rare words can ruin comprehension.</p>

    <h2>The Role of AI Tutors (GPALTs)</h2>
    <p>This is where AI tutors come in. GPT-powered AI Language Teachers (GPALTs) can generate content that’s tailored to your vocabulary, your interests, and your goals.</p>
    <p>They provide context-rich, adaptive conversations that make new words easier to learn.</p>
    <p>They can help you master niche topics, whether business Japanese, anime, or law, and expand into new domains by building on what you already know.</p>

    <h2>Where Language Apps Should Go Next</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Apps should specialize by level. Let learners “graduate” from one tool to the next.</li>
        <li>User data, like vocabulary knowledge, should be portable across platforms.</li>
        <li>AI should play a central role in tailoring the experience at higher levels.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Helping learners move past plateaus isn’t just educational, it’s social. For many, language is key to visas, jobs, and integration. Getting this right means giving more people a fair shot at success.</p>

    <h2>The Research Behind This</h2>
    <p>This post is based on original research involving 198 Japanese learners, Duolingo’s vocabulary set, and comparisons with JLPT exam lists and Japanese Wikipedia frequency data. The aim: to understand why learners get stuck, and how to help them break through.</p>
